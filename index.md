# Welcome to Podcast Accessibility

Your podcast should be accessible. But what does that mean, exactly? Why should you care? What can you do to improve the accessibility? 

We're going to answer these questions for you! We'll help you get your podcast, and your podcast site, as accessible as possible.

## Why

There are many reasons why you ought to make your podcast accessible. The primary reason is to make sure people with disabilities can access your content. It is also about reaching a wider audience (every listen counts, right?). It is also about helping you identify and use your content more easily.

## How

There are a few things that you can do to make your show more accessible. First, provide transcripts. Then, focus on your website and media player. Transcripts are the easiest to implement from a tech perspective. Website and media player might take a bit more doing, particularly if you're not comfortable with website building. But this is within the reach of most people!
