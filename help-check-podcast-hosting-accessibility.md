There are a variety of podcast hosting services. Some are more popular than others. But very few appear to be accessible - both in terms of pushing accessible podcasts and podcast pages, but also in terms of being used by disabled podcasters. I'm looking for help making a list of the pros and cons of each ones, when it comes to accessibility.

## Podcasting services
Here is a non-exhaustive list of podcast hosting services I would like to start with. If you use and/or know one that isn't in this list, by all means, add it and start doing an assessment!
* [Libsyn](https://www.libsyn.com/)
* [Podbean](https://www.podbean.com/)
* [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/)
* [Podomatic](https://www.podomatic.com/)
* [Buzzsprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/)
* [Simplecast](https://simplecast.com/)
* [Castos](https://castos.com/)
* [This Is a Cast](https://tryca.st/)

And if anyone from these services wants to provide a self-assessment, please, do so! I welcome all information about these services.

## What to check

What makes a podcast accessible? Well, as you may garner from the entirety of the site, several things. Here are some basic items for a quick check:

* Are there transcripts available?
	* For every show?
	* Where are they located? On the same page? On a separate page? As a download? Etc.
* Is the media player keyboard accessible?
	* Can you get to the player by using the tab key on your keyboard?
	* Can you reach and activate every interactive element in the player with only the keyboard? 
	* Can you see where the focus is on the player when tabbing through with a keyboard?
* Media player screen reader accessibility?
  * I'll check that myself, unless you're familiar with screen readers, at which point do check and let me know!
* Is the website accessible?
	* This one, I'm not asking you to check. I'll do a review of the services that come back to me before publishing.

## How to provide this information
Please put the information on the GitHub page, send a pull request.

If you do not have a GitHub account or are intimidated by GitHub, please send me a tweet to organize a different way to provide me the information.

## Formatting the information
Please do make sure to itemize each point listed above with a "yes/no/maybe" and provide notes if and when appropriate. Don't worry too much about the formatting. I'll clean that up.
