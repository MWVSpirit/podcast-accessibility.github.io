## About this site

### Why it got started

Nic runs the A11y Rules Podcast, a show about web accessibility. He wants to spread the word about podcast accessibility, because he's passionate about accessibilty.

### Who is behind it

#### Nicolas Steenhout

A developer in the mid-'90s, Nicolas Steenhout was approached by clients facing issues not yet part of the public consciousness. On the emerging web, accessibility hurdles were keeping people with disabilities from engaging with a technological revolution. 

Confronted by this gap within the digital landscape, Nic began championing web accessibility. He transitioned into the non-profit sector where he collaborated with people with a wide variety of impairments and was introduced to new assistive technologies. 

Twenty years on, Nic continues his accessibility work as a consultant for both the private and non-profit sectors. Having worked on three continents, he’s engaged with thousands of individuals with disabilities. Blogger, podcaster, public speaker, Nic offers real-world insight into everyday accessibility issues.
