## List of accessible podcasts

This is not an exhaustive list of accessible podcasts, but every time we come across a podcast that is accessible, we'll add it here. Please feel free to add other accessible podcasts you come across. 

**Do note** - While we will make every possible effort to double check new entries, we cannot guarantee the podcasts on this list are accessible. **Further note** that the website for these podcasts may not be accessible, but at a minimum, transcripts are provided.
