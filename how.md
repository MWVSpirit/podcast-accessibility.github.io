There are a few things to do to improve your podcast's accessibility.

* Add [transcripts](#transcripts) to your shows.
* Ensure your website is accessible.
* Pick an accessible [media player](#media-player).

## Transcripts {#transcripts}

Transcripts are, arguably, the most important thing you can do to increase your show's accessibility. You will benefit from providing transcripts yourself, beyond increased accessibility. 


You can create your own transcripts. You can also use commercial services to get automated or human generated transcripts. The best way to provide a transcript is inline on the show's page itself, but you can also provide downloadable or linked transcripts.

## Media players {#media-player}

The media player you use will make a difference as to whether or not people with disabilities will be able to use it. At a bare minimum, it should be operable by keyboard only. Focus should be visible on each control. And controls need to be clearly labelled in a way that a screen reader can understand and announce the controls properly.
