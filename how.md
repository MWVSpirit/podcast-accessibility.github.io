There are a few things to do to improve your podcast's accessibility.

* Add transcripts to your shows.
* Ensure your website is accessible.
* Pick an accessible media player.

## Transcripts

Transcripts are, arguably, the most important thing you can do to increase your show's accessibility. You will benefit from providing transcripts yourself, beyond increased accessibility. 


You can create your own transcripts. You can also use commercial services to get automated or human generated transcripts. The best way to provide a transcript is inline on the show's page itself, but you can also provide downloadable or linked transcripts.
